This repository aims to run an example code using abci on tendermint. As of now code is not running, because of the verification error somewhere in socket server.
Thing to be done
1. map this with the implementation of KVstore application already present on the tendermint page and then decide what changes could make this work
2. better to download those go files in this repository
3. once done, modify it to some another code
